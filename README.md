This project is tailored to help financial institutions and ATM service providers optimize performance, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement
Managing a network of ATMs is a complex task, with challenges including:
1.Tracking financial and non-financial transactions to assess usage trends.
2.Monitoring maintenance costs across regions and categories (e.g., site maintenance, spare parts, AMC).
3.Understanding regional performance in terms of revenue and profitability.
4.Ensuring high ATM uptime to improve customer experience.
5.Identifying underperforming ATMs or regions requiring intervention.

This dashboard addresses these challenges by providing actionable insights into ATM performance, transaction trends, and revenue distribution.
